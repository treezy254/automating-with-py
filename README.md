# automating-with-py
HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Samuel

For this repository I was practicing how to automate boring comp work using python.
The codes are extra extensive, and cover multiple ranges of topics and python libraries.
But in the end I feel proud of myself for completing it.
I also had fun writing them codes.
 
The topics include: 
  Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions
  Input Validation
  Reading and writing Files 
  Organizing files
  Debugging
  Web Scrapping
  Working with CSV and JSON Data
  Keeping Time, Scheduling Tasks, and launching Programs
  Sending Email and Text Messages
  Manipulating Images
  Controlling the keyboard and Mouse with GUI Automation
  
 N/B : Don't run all the programs at once, mini programs are emebeded within program.
 Take you time time to read through them.
 The codes are well written and easy to understand with comments wherever possible.
 Thankyou.
